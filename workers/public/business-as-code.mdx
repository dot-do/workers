title: Business-as-Code
---

Business-as-Code is the idea that if a company, it’s Purpose, Goals, Org Structure, Processes, and Workflows can be codified and managed as code, then AI can be used to develop strategies, perform short & long-term planning, define experiments, and execute processes and workflows through the delivery of tasks in a work queue.

For example, imagine a lending broker that acquires traffic of consumers looking for loans, captures credit applications, evaluates credit history, and offers credit terms along with ancillary financial & insurance products and services. If the consumer accepts the offer and provides any requested documentation, the broker verifies identity, income, employment, assets, collateral, residence, and any other stipulation or documentation needed to fund the deal and sell it to a lender.
